# Deep-Learning

Inspired by numerous articles and posts to dive into Machine Learning and subsequently Deep Learning. 
I will try and add explanations to each code. 
Planning to add numerous tutorials and codes for essential Deep Learning components like Activation Functions, Optimizers, Cost Functions etc. 
Types of Neural Networks too with a corrseponding tutorial will be added.
