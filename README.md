# Deep-Learning

Inspired by numerous articles and posts to dive into Machine Learning and subsequently Deep Learning. <br/>
I will try and add explanations to each code. <br/>
Planning to add numerous tutorials and codes for essential Deep Learning components like Activation Functions, Optimizers, Cost Functions etc. <br/>
Types of Neural Networks too with a corrseponding tutorial will be added.<br/>
